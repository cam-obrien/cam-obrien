## Hello all, welcome to my Github!

I am a new graduate from Oregon State University with a B.S. in Computer Science with a minor in Business Administration. 

I am seeking to utilize my broad educational background with an excellent analytical, technical, and inclusive skill set to thrive as a developer. The vast experience I gained during my OSU curriculum in Computer Science has readied me to seamlessly enter the field of software engineering.

I am currently working on a wide variety of projects to better familiarize myself with technologies being used by current professionals. Please feel free to visit my personal website linked below to view more of my story, check out some of my favorite projects, or get in direct contact with me through email.
